MICROTHON, the ultimate coding challenge, Organized by Opteamix <https://www.opteamix.com/>.

The Code for Puzzle:
There are three baskets, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The baskets have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the basket it labels. Opening just one basket, and without looking in the basket, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the baskets correctly?
